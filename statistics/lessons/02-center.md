# Lesson 2: The centre: mean, median and mode

**You'll learn:** mean, median, mode, outliers, skew, choosing a "typical" value, weighted mean.

## Key terms

- **Mean:** the sum of the values divided by how many there are; the "average".
- **Median:** the middle value when the values are sorted.
- **Mode:** the most common value.
- **Outlier:** a value far from the others.
- **Skewed:** having a long tail on one side.
- **Robust:** not much affected by outliers. The median is robust; the mean is not.
- **Weighted mean:** an average where some values count more than others.

"What's a typical value?" has three common answers:

| Measure | What it is | pandas |
|---|---|---|
| **Mean** | add everything up, divide by how many | `s.mean()` |
| **Median** | the middle value when sorted | `s.median()` |
| **Mode** | the most common value | `s.mode()` |

```python
import pandas as pd

scores = pd.Series([4, 7, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12])
print("mean  ", scores.mean())
print("median", scores.median())
print("mode  ", scores.mode().tolist())
```

With an even number of values the median is the average of the middle two. `mode()` returns a list because there can be ties.

## Outliers pull the mean

The mean uses every value's size, so one extreme value drags it. The median only cares about order, so it barely moves:

```python
import pandas as pd

salaries = pd.Series([38, 41, 44, 46, 52])          # thousands
print(salaries.mean(), salaries.median())

salaries_with_ceo = pd.concat([salaries, pd.Series([900])])
print(salaries_with_ceo.mean().round(1), salaries_with_ceo.median())
```

One CEO turned an average salary of 44k into 187k, but the median only moved from 44 to 45. That's why house prices and incomes are usually reported as medians.

![Histogram of incomes with a long right tail: the dashed mean line sits to the right of the solid median line](../figures/mean-median-skew.svg)

When data has a long tail on one side (it's **skewed**), the mean is pulled towards the tail. In the picture, most people earn 20–60k, but a few very high earners stretch the tail to the right, so the mean (54k) sits above the median (41k). **Rule of thumb:** if the mean and median are far apart, report the median, or both.

## Which one to use

| Data | Best "typical" value |
|---|---|
| roughly symmetric, no extreme values | mean (or median: they agree) |
| skewed or with outliers (incomes, prices, waiting times) | median |
| categories (most popular city, product) | mode |

## Centre by group

Combining `groupby` with these summaries answers "typical value for each group":

```python
import pandas as pd

sales = pd.read_csv("sales.csv")
sales["revenue"] = sales["units"] * sales["unit_price"]
print(sales.groupby("category")["revenue"].agg(["mean", "median"]).round(1))
```

For Electronics, the mean order (about 730) is more than double the median (about 320): a few laptop orders drag it up. Which number you report changes the story, so say which you used.

## Weighted mean

Sometimes values count unequally. A **weighted mean** multiplies each value by its weight, adds them up, and divides by the total weight. NumPy's `np.average` does it:

```python
import numpy as np

grades = np.array([72, 85, 90])      # coursework, midterm, final
weights = np.array([0.2, 0.3, 0.5])  # how much each counts
print(np.average(grades, weights=weights))
print(grades.mean())                 # the unweighted mean is different
```

## Common mistakes

- Reporting the mean for skewed data like incomes, waiting times or order values. Check the median too.
- Forgetting that `mode()` can return several values. Use `mode()[0]` for one.
- Comparing means of groups without looking at how many rows each group has.

## Exercises

### 1. Typical order

Load `sales.csv` and add `revenue` (units × unit_price). Store the **mean** revenue per order in `mean_rev` and the **median** in `median_rev`. Then set `report` to the string `"median"` if the mean is more than 20% above the median, otherwise `"mean"`.

Starter code:

```python
import pandas as pd

sales = pd.read_csv("sales.csv")

```

### 2. Most common product

Load `sales.csv` and store the most frequently ordered `product` (the mode) in `top_product`, as a string.

Starter code:

```python
import pandas as pd

sales = pd.read_csv("sales.csv")

```

1. "More than 20% above" means `mean_rev > 1.2 * median_rev`.
2. `mode()` returns a Series; take its first item with `[0]`.

**1. Typical order**

```python
import pandas as pd

sales = pd.read_csv("sales.csv")
sales["revenue"] = sales["units"] * sales["unit_price"]
mean_rev = sales["revenue"].mean()
median_rev = sales["revenue"].median()
report = "median" if mean_rev > 1.2 * median_rev else "mean"
print(mean_rev, median_rev, report)
```

**2. Most common product**

```python
import pandas as pd

sales = pd.read_csv("sales.csv")
top_product = sales["product"].mode()[0]
print(top_product)
```

## Quick quiz

1. House prices in a city have a few mansions. Which "typical price" is most honest?
   - A) Mean
   - B) Median
   - C) Mode

2. In a right-skewed dataset, where is the mean compared with the median?
   - A) Higher (pulled towards the long right tail)
   - B) Lower
   - C) Always equal

3. What does `s.mode()` return?
   - A) A single number
   - B) A Series, because several values can tie for most common
   - C) The middle value

1. **B) Median**: The few very expensive homes pull the mean up; the median shows what a typical home costs.
2. **A) Higher (pulled towards the long right tail)**: The long tail of big values drags the mean in their direction.
3. **B) A Series, because several values can tie for most common**: Take `s.mode()[0]` when you want one value.
