# Lesson 16: Linked list patterns: reverse, fast and slow pointers, merge

**You'll learn:** reversing in place, recursion vs iteration, fast and slow pointers, the middle node, Floyd's cycle detection and cycle start, merging sorted lists, a gap of k, palindrome lists.

▶ **Practise this lesson in the [sandbox](https://kishoremadanagopal.github.io/learning/dsa/#linked-list-patterns)**: run every example and check your exercise answers.

## Key terms

- **In-place:** changing the existing structure instead of building a new one, using O(1) extra memory.
- **Fast and slow pointers:** two pointers moving at different speeds (usually 2 steps and 1 step) through a list.
- **Floyd's cycle detection:** the tortoise-and-hare method: if fast and slow ever meet, there's a cycle.
- **Cycle:** a loop in the links, so following `next` never reaches None.
- **Merge:** combining two sorted sequences into one sorted sequence.
- **Stable:** keeping equal items in their original order.

Almost every linked-list question is a combination of four moves. Learn them as templates.

## 1. Reverse a list in place

Walk the list once, turning every `next` arrow around. You need three pointers: `prev` (the reversed part so far), `cur` (the node being turned) and `nxt` (saved so you don't lose the rest).

![Reversing 1 → 2 → 3 step by step. At each step, cur's next arrow is turned to point at prev, then prev and cur move one node right. At the end, prev is the new head: 3 → 2 → 1 → None](../figures/reverse-list.svg)

```python
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val, next=None):
        self.val, self.next = val, next

def build(values):
    head = None
    for v in reversed(values):
        head = ListNode(v, head)
    return head

def to_list(head):
    out = []
    while head:
        out.append(head.val)
        head = head.next
    return out

def reverse(head):
    prev, cur = None, head
    while cur:
        nxt = cur.next      # 1. remember the rest
        cur.next = prev     # 2. turn the arrow around
        prev = cur          # 3. move both pointers one step
        cur = nxt
    return prev             # prev is the old tail = the new head

print(to_list(reverse(build([1, 2, 3, 4]))))
```

O(n) time, O(1) space. A recursive version exists (reverse the rest, then hook the current node on the end) but uses O(n) call-stack space and crashes past Python's recursion limit of about 1,000 nodes, so prefer the loop.

```python
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val, next=None):
        self.val, self.next = val, next

def reverse_recursive(head):
    if head is None or head.next is None:
        return head                      # 0 or 1 node: already reversed
    new_head = reverse_recursive(head.next)
    head.next.next = head                # the node after me now points back at me
    head.next = None
    return new_head

head = ListNode(1, ListNode(2, ListNode(3)))
node = reverse_recursive(head)
print(node.val, node.next.val, node.next.next.val)
```

## 2. Fast and slow pointers

Two pointers start at the head; `slow` moves one step, `fast` moves two. When `fast` reaches the end, `slow` is in the **middle**:

```python
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val, next=None):
        self.val, self.next = val, next

def build(values):
    head = None
    for v in reversed(values):
        head = ListNode(v, head)
    return head

def middle(head):
    slow = fast = head
    while fast and fast.next:
        slow = slow.next
        fast = fast.next.next
    return slow

print(middle(build([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])).val, middle(build([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])).val)
```

(For an even length, this returns the second of the two middle nodes.)

**Cycle detection (Floyd's tortoise and hare).** If a list loops back on itself, a plain walk never ends. With fast and slow pointers, if there's a cycle, the fast one eventually laps the slow one and they meet; if there isn't, fast falls off the end. O(n) time and **O(1) space**, where a "visited" set would need O(n).

![A list 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → 6 whose last node points back to 3, forming a loop. The slow pointer moves one step at a time and the fast pointer two; they meet inside the loop. Resetting one pointer to the head and moving both one step at a time makes them meet again at 3, the start of the cycle](../figures/fast-slow.svg)

```python
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val, next=None):
        self.val, self.next = val, next

def has_cycle(head):
    slow = fast = head
    while fast and fast.next:
        slow, fast = slow.next, fast.next.next
        if slow is fast:                 # same node object, not just the same value
            return True
    return False

def cycle_start(head):
    slow = fast = head
    while fast and fast.next:
        slow, fast = slow.next, fast.next.next
        if slow is fast:                 # they met inside the loop
            slow = head                  # restart one pointer from the head
            while slow is not fast:      # both move 1 step; they meet at the loop's start
                slow, fast = slow.next, fast.next
            return slow
    return None

nodes = [ListNode(v) for v in [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]]
for a, b in zip(nodes, nodes[1:]):
    a.next = b
nodes[-1].next = nodes[2]                # 6 -> 3 makes a loop
print(has_cycle(nodes[0]), cycle_start(nodes[0]).val)
```

Why does restarting find the start? If the head is *a* steps before the loop and they meet *b* steps into the loop, the fast pointer travelled twice as far as the slow one; working that out shows *a* equals the distance from the meeting point forward to the loop's start (plus whole laps). So two pointers moving one step at a time from the head and from the meeting point arrive at the start together.

## 3. Merge two sorted lists

Like merging two sorted arrays (Lesson 7), but you **relink** existing nodes instead of copying values: O(n + m) time, O(1) extra space.

```python
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val, next=None):
        self.val, self.next = val, next

def build(values):
    head = None
    for v in reversed(values):
        head = ListNode(v, head)
    return head

def to_list(head):
    out = []
    while head:
        out.append(head.val)
        head = head.next
    return out

def merge(a, b):
    dummy = tail = ListNode(0)
    while a and b:
        if a.val <= b.val:
            tail.next, a = a, a.next
        else:
            tail.next, b = b, b.next
        tail = tail.next
    tail.next = a or b                  # attach whatever is left
    return dummy.next

print(to_list(merge(build([1, 4, 9]), build([2, 3, 10, 12]))))
```

## 4. A gap of k: remove the k-th node from the end

Move a `lead` pointer k steps ahead, then move `lead` and `trail` together. When `lead` falls off the end, `trail` is just before the node to remove. One pass, no length needed.

```python
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val, next=None):
        self.val, self.next = val, next

def build(values):
    head = None
    for v in reversed(values):
        head = ListNode(v, head)
    return head

def to_list(head):
    out = []
    while head:
        out.append(head.val)
        head = head.next
    return out

def remove_kth_from_end(head, k):
    dummy = ListNode(0, head)
    lead = trail = dummy
    for _ in range(k):
        lead = lead.next
    while lead.next:
        lead, trail = lead.next, trail.next
    trail.next = trail.next.next
    return dummy.next

print(to_list(remove_kth_from_end(build([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]), 2)))
```

## Putting moves together: is the list a palindrome?

Find the middle (fast/slow), reverse the second half, compare the halves: O(n) time, O(1) space.

```python
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val, next=None):
        self.val, self.next = val, next

def build(values):
    head = None
    for v in reversed(values):
        head = ListNode(v, head)
    return head

def is_palindrome(head):
    slow = fast = head
    while fast and fast.next:            # 1. find the middle
        slow, fast = slow.next, fast.next.next
    prev = None
    while slow:                          # 2. reverse the second half
        slow.next, prev, slow = prev, slow, slow.next
    left, right = head, prev
    while right:                         # 3. compare
        if left.val != right.val:
            return False
        left, right = left.next, right.next
    return True

print(is_palindrome(build([1, 2, 3, 2, 1])), is_palindrome(build([1, 2, 2, 3])))
```

## At a glance

| Concept | Approach | Time | Space |
|---|---|---|---|
| Reverse a list | prev / cur / next, turn each arrow around | O(n) | O(1) (recursive: O(n) stack) |
| Middle node | slow 1 step, fast 2 steps | O(n) | O(1) |
| Detect a cycle (Floyd) | fast and slow meet if there's a loop | O(n) | O(1) |
| Find the cycle's start | after meeting, restart one pointer at the head; step both by 1 | O(n) | O(1) |
| Merge two sorted lists | dummy + tail; attach the smaller front | O(n + m) | O(1) |
| Remove k-th from the end | lead k steps ahead, then move both | O(n) | O(1) |
| Palindrome list | middle, reverse the second half, compare | O(n) | O(1) |

## Common mistakes

- Comparing node values (`==`) instead of node identity (`is`) when detecting cycles.
- Reversing recursively on long lists in Python, which hits the recursion limit.
- Forgetting to attach the leftover nodes after a merge loop.
- Checking `fast.next.next` without first checking `fast` and `fast.next`.

## Exercises

### 1. Reverse a linked list

Write `reverse_list(head)` that reverses the list **in place** (relink the nodes; don't create new ones) and returns the new head. It must handle 100,000 nodes, so use a loop, not recursion.

Starter code:

```python
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

def build(values):
    head = None
    for v in reversed(values):
        head = ListNode(v, head)
    return head

def to_list(head):
    out = []
    while head:
        out.append(head.val)
        head = head.next
    return out

def reverse_list(head):
    pass

print(to_list(reverse_list(build([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]))))
```

<summary>🧭 How to approach it</summary>

1. **Understand:** relink, don't copy; return the new head (the old tail); empty and one-node lists are valid.
2. **Examples:** 1→2→3 becomes 3→2→1; None stays None.
3. **Brute force:** read the values into a list and write them back reversed: O(n) extra space, and it changes values instead of links.
4. **Pattern:** **pointer reversal with prev / cur / next**.
5. **Plan:** prev = None, cur = head; while cur: save next, point cur back at prev, advance both; return prev.
6. **Code and test:** test empty, one node, two nodes.

</details>

<details>
<summary>💡 Hint 1</summary>

As you walk forward, make each node point to the node **before** it. What do you need to remember so you don't lose the rest of the list?

</details>

<details>
<summary>💡 Hint 2</summary>

Keep three pointers: `prev` (starts as None), `cur` (starts at head) and `nxt` (saved before you change `cur.next`).

</details>

<details>
<summary>💡 Hint 3</summary>

Loop while `cur`: `nxt = cur.next; cur.next = prev; prev = cur; cur = nxt`. Return `prev`.

</details>

### 2. Detect a cycle

Write `has_cycle(head)` that returns `True` if following `next` pointers ever loops back to an earlier node, otherwise `False`. Aim for O(1) extra space (no set of visited nodes).

Starter code:

```python
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

def has_cycle(head):
    pass
```

<details>
<summary>🧭 How to approach it</summary>

1. **Understand:** detect a loop in the links, not repeated values; O(1) space wanted.
2. **Examples:** 3→2→0→−4→(back to 2) → True; 1→2→3 → False; one node pointing at itself → True.
3. **Brute force:** remember every visited node in a set: O(n) time, O(n) space.
4. **Pattern:** **fast and slow pointers** (Floyd).
5. **Plan:** slow and fast start at head; while fast and fast.next exist, step them; meeting means a cycle; reaching the end means none.
6. **Code and test:** empty list, one node, a self-loop, equal values without a loop.

</details>

<details>
<summary>💡 Hint 1</summary>

Without a loop, a walk reaches `None`. With a loop, it goes round forever. How can two walkers tell the difference?

</details>

<details>
<summary>💡 Hint 2</summary>

Floyd's tortoise and hare: `slow` moves 1 step, `fast` moves 2. In a loop, fast catches slow; without one, fast hits the end.

</details>

<details>
<summary>💡 Hint 3</summary>

`while fast and fast.next:` move both, then `if slow is fast: return True`. After the loop, `return False`. Use `is` to compare nodes.

</details>

### 3. Merge two sorted lists

Write `merge_lists(a, b)` that merges two sorted linked lists into one sorted list by **relinking** their nodes, and returns its head.

Starter code:

```python
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

def build(values):
    head = None
    for v in reversed(values):
        head = ListNode(v, head)
    return head

def to_list(head):
    out = []
    while head:
        out.append(head.val)
        head = head.next
    return out

def merge_lists(a, b):
    pass

print(to_list(merge_lists(build([1, 2, 4]), build([1, 3, 4]))))
```

<details>
<summary>🧭 How to approach it</summary>

1. **Understand:** both inputs sorted; output sorted; reuse the nodes; either list may be empty.
2. **Examples:** [1, 2, 4] + [1, 3, 4] → [1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4]; [] + [0] → [0].
3. **Brute force:** collect all values, sort, rebuild: O((n+m) log(n+m)) and new nodes.
4. **Pattern:** **merge with two pointers + dummy head** (same idea as merge sort's merge step).
5. **Plan:** dummy and tail; while both remain, attach the smaller; then attach the remainder.
6. **Code and test:** empties, one list running out first, equal values.

</details>

<details>
<summary>💡 Hint 1</summary>

At each step, which of the two front nodes should come next in the result?

<details>

Use a dummy node and a `tail` pointer to the end of the merged list. Attach the smaller front node, then advance that list.

`while a and b:` attach the smaller and move on; after the loop, `tail.next = a or b` attaches the leftover part in one step.

<summary>✅ 1. Reverse a linked list</summary>

```python
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

def build(values):
    head = None
    for v in reversed(values):
        head = ListNode(v, head)
    return head

def to_list(head):
    out = []
    while head:
        out.append(head.val)
        head = head.next
    return out

def reverse_list(head):
    prev, cur = None, head
    while cur:
        nxt = cur.next       # save the rest of the list
        cur.next = prev      # turn this node's arrow around
        prev, cur = cur, nxt # step forward
    return prev

print(to_list(reverse_list(build([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]))))
```

**Line by line**

- `prev = None`: the old head will become the last node, so it must end up pointing at `None`.
- `nxt = cur.next` must come first: the next line overwrites `cur.next`, and without the saved copy the rest of the list would be unreachable.
- `cur.next = prev` turns the arrow around.
- `prev, cur = cur, nxt` moves both pointers one node forward.
- When `cur` is `None`, `prev` is the last node we turned around: the new head.

**Trace** on 1 → 2 → 3:

| step | prev | cur | nxt | links after the step |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | None → 1 | 1 → 2 | 2 | 1 → None |
| 2 | 1 → 2 | 2 → 3 | 3 | 2 → 1 → None |
| 3 | 2 → 3 | 3 → None | None | 3 → 2 → 1 → None |

Return `prev` = 3.

**Complexity:** O(n) time, O(1) extra space.

**Common wrong approach:** the recursive version is elegant but uses one call-stack frame per node, so 100,000 nodes raise `RecursionError` in Python.

</details>

<details>
<summary>✅ 2. Detect a cycle</summary>

```python
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

def has_cycle(head):
    slow = fast = head
    while fast and fast.next:
        slow = slow.next
        fast = fast.next.next
        if slow is fast:          # the fast pointer caught up from behind: there's a loop
            return True
    return False                  # fast reached the end: no loop
```

**Line by line**

- Both pointers start at the head.
- `while fast and fast.next:` guards both steps of the fast pointer: if either is `None`, the list has an end, so there's no cycle.
- Each round, the gap between them grows by one node. Inside a loop of length L, the fast pointer gains one node per round, so it must land exactly on the slow one within L rounds.
- `slow is fast` compares **objects**. `slow.val == fast.val` would wrongly report a cycle for 5 → 5 → 5.

**Trace** on 3 → 2 → 0 → −4 → (back to 2):

| round | slow | fast | same node? |
|---|---|---|---|
| start | 3 | 3 | — |
| 1 | 2 | 0 | no |
| 2 | 0 | 2 | no |
| 3 | −4 | −4 | **yes** → True |

**Complexity:** O(n) time, O(1) extra space.

**Common wrong approach:** comparing values instead of nodes, or looping with `while fast.next.next`, which crashes with `AttributeError` when `fast.next` is `None`.

        self.next = next

def build(values):
    head = None
    for v in reversed(values):
        head = ListNode(v, head)
    return head

def to_list(head):
    out = []
    while head:
        out.append(head.val)
        head = head.next
    return out

def merge_lists(a, b):
    dummy = tail = ListNode(0)
    while a and b:

            tail.next = b
            b = b.next
        tail = tail.next
    tail.next = a if a else b      # one list is finished: attach the other's remainder
    return dummy.next

print(to_list(merge_lists(build([1, 2, 4]), build([1, 3, 4]))))
```

**Line by line**

- `dummy = tail = ListNode(0)`: `tail` always points at the last node of the merged list.
- Each round compares the two fronts and attaches the smaller (`<=` keeps equal values in their original order: a **stable** merge).
- `tail = tail.next` moves to the node just attached.
- When one list runs out, the rest of the other is already sorted, so `tail.next = a if a else b` attaches it all at once.

**Trace** on [1, 4] and [2, 3]:

| a | b | attach | merged so far |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 2 | 1 | 1 |
| 4 | 2 | 2 | 1, 2 |
| 4 | 3 | 3 | 1, 2, 3 |
| 4 | None | rest of a | 1, 2, 3, 4 |

**Complexity:** O(n + m) time, O(1) extra space.

**Common wrong approach:** forgetting the leftover nodes after the loop, which silently drops the end of the longer list.

## Quick quiz

1. Reversing a list, why must you save cur.next before changing it?
   - A) Changing cur.next would otherwise lose the only link to the rest of the list
   - B) Python requires a temporary variable for every assignment
   - C) It makes the loop faster

2. In fast/slow pointers, where is slow when fast reaches the end?
   - A) In the middle of the list
   - B) At the head
   - C) At the end too

3. Why is Floyd's cycle detection better than storing visited nodes in a set?
   - A) It uses O(1) extra memory instead of O(n)
   - B) It's always faster
   - C) It works on unsorted lists only

4. To remove the 2nd node from the end in one pass, you:
   - A) Move a lead pointer 2 steps ahead, then move lead and trail together until lead reaches the end
   - B) Reverse the list twice
   - C) Count the length first, then walk again

<summary>Quiz answers</summary>

1. **A) Changing cur.next would otherwise lose the only link to the rest of the list**: The next pointer is the only way to reach the remaining nodes.
2. **A) In the middle of the list**: Fast moves twice as far, so slow has covered half the distance.
3. **A) It uses O(1) extra memory instead of O(n)**: Both are O(n) time; the two-pointer version needs no extra storage.
4. **A) Move a lead pointer 2 steps ahead, then move lead and trail together until lead reaches the end**: The fixed gap means trail stops right before the node to remove. (Counting first also works, but takes two passes.)
