## Key terms

- **gcd / lcm:** the greatest common divisor / least common multiple of two numbers.
- **Euclid's algorithm:** gcd(a, b) = gcd(b, a mod b) until b is 0.
- **Prime:** an integer greater than 1 whose only divisors are 1 and itself.
- **Sieve of Eratosthenes:** finds all primes below n by crossing out multiples of each prime.
- **Modular arithmetic:** arithmetic on remainders after division by a modulus m.
- **Modular inverse:** the number b⁻¹ with b · b⁻¹ ≡ 1 (mod m); it replaces division.
- **Fermat's little theorem:** for a prime p and a not divisible by p, a^(p−1) ≡ 1, so a^(p−2) is a's inverse.
- **Combination C(n, k):** the number of ways to choose k items from n when order doesn't matter.
- **Reservoir sampling:** choosing k random items from a stream in one pass with O(k) memory.

A handful of mathematical tools come up again and again in coding problems: when answers are huge ("give the answer modulo 10⁹ + 7"), when a problem is secretly about divisibility or primes, or when you need to pick random items fairly. Python makes several of them one-liners, but you should know what's underneath.

## Greatest common divisor and least common multiple

**Euclid's algorithm:** gcd(a, b) = gcd(b, a mod b), stopping when b is 0. Each step at least halves the numbers every two rounds, so it's O(log min(a, b)). The **lcm** follows from it: lcm(a, b) = a × b / gcd(a, b).

```python
import math

def gcd(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b              # gcd(48, 18) -> gcd(18, 12) -> gcd(12, 6) -> gcd(6, 0) = 6
    return a

print(gcd(48, 18), math.gcd(48, 18), math.gcd(12, 18, 30))    # math.gcd accepts many numbers (3.9+)
print(48 * 18 // gcd(48, 18), math.lcm(4, 6, 10))
```

Uses: simplifying fractions, checking whether two numbers share a factor, repeating patterns (two cycles of lengths a and b line up every lcm(a, b) steps).

## Primes

To test one number, try divisors up to **√n**: if n = a × b, one of them is at most √n. O(√n). To find **all** primes below n, the **sieve of Eratosthenes** crosses out the multiples of each prime, starting at p² (smaller multiples were already crossed out by smaller primes). O(n log log n), practically linear.

![The numbers 2 to 30 in a grid. Multiples of 2 are crossed out in one colour, then multiples of 3 from 9, then multiples of 5 from 25. The numbers left, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23 and 29, are the primes](../figures/sieve.svg)

```python
import math

def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for d in range(2, math.isqrt(n) + 1):     # isqrt: exact integer square root
        if n % d == 0:
            return False
    return True

def primes_below(n):
    is_p = [True] * n
    is_p[0:2] = [False, False]
    for p in range(2, math.isqrt(n - 1) + 1):
        if is_p[p]:
            for multiple in range(p * p, n, p):
                is_p[multiple] = False
    return [i for i, flag in enumerate(is_p) if flag]

def factorise(n):                              # prime factors by trial division: O(√n)
    factors, d = [], 2
    while d * d <= n:
        while n % d == 0:
            factors.append(d)
            n //= d
        d += 1
    if n > 1:
        factors.append(n)                      # whatever is left is a prime
    return factors

print(is_prime(97), is_prime(91), primes_below(30))
print(factorise(360), factorise(2 ** 31 - 1))
```

## Modular arithmetic

When answers would have thousands of digits, problems ask for them **modulo** a prime, usually 10⁹ + 7 (a prime that fits comfortably in 32 bits, so products fit in 64 bits in other languages). You can take the remainder after **every** addition, subtraction and multiplication, so numbers stay small:

- (a + b) mod m = ((a mod m) + (b mod m)) mod m, and the same for − and ×.
- **Division doesn't work that way.** Dividing by b means multiplying by b's **modular inverse**: the number b⁻¹ with b × b⁻¹ ≡ 1 (mod m). It exists when gcd(b, m) = 1. For a prime m, **Fermat's little theorem** gives b⁻¹ = b^(m−2) mod m.

```python
MOD = 10**9 + 7

print(pow(3, 200, MOD))                  # fast modular power, built in (Lesson 22 wrote it by hand)
inv3 = pow(3, -1, MOD)                   # modular inverse (Python 3.8+)
print(inv3, 3 * inv3 % MOD, pow(3, MOD - 2, MOD) == inv3)
print(10 * inv3 % MOD == 10 * pow(3, MOD - 2, MOD) % MOD)    # "10 / 3" in modular arithmetic
print(-7 % 3, (-7) // 3)                 # Python's % is never negative for a positive modulus (C and Java give -1)
```

## Counting: permutations and combinations

- Orderings of n items: n!. Ordered choices of k from n: P(n, k) = n! / (n − k)!.
- Unordered choices of k from n: C(n, k) = n! / (k! (n − k)!), "n choose k". `math.comb` and `math.perm` compute them exactly.
- **Pascal's rule** C(n, k) = C(n − 1, k − 1) + C(n − 1, k) builds a table by DP, handy for small n or when you need many values.
- For many C(n, k) **modulo a prime**, precompute factorials and **inverse factorials** once (O(n)), then each query is O(1): C(n, k) = n! × (k!)⁻¹ × ((n − k)!)⁻¹ mod p. That's the second exercise.

```python
import math

print(math.factorial(5), math.perm(5, 2), math.comb(5, 2))

pascal = [[1]]
for n in range(1, 6):                       # Pascal's triangle: each entry is the sum of the two above
    prev = pascal[-1]
    pascal.append([1] + [prev[k - 1] + prev[k] for k in range(1, n)] + [1])
for row in pascal:
    print(row)

catalan = [math.comb(2 * n, n) // (n + 1) for n in range(8)]
print("Catalan numbers:", catalan)          # balanced bracket strings, binary tree shapes, ...
```

Counting problems in interviews are often a C(n, k) in disguise: paths in a grid (C(m + n − 2, m − 1), Lesson 43), ways to choose a team, the number of binary strings with k ones. The **Catalan numbers** count balanced bracket sequences of n pairs and binary trees with n nodes.

## Exact integers, inexact floats

Python's `int` never overflows, so you'll never see the wrap-around bugs of C or Java. **Floats** are the danger: they're binary fractions with about 15–16 significant digits, so many decimals can't be stored exactly.

```python
import math
from fractions import Fraction
from decimal import Decimal

print(0.1 + 0.2, 0.1 + 0.2 == 0.3, math.isclose(0.1 + 0.2, 0.3))
print(Fraction(1, 10) + Fraction(2, 10), Decimal("0.1") + Decimal("0.2"))
print(int(math.sqrt(10**30 - 1)), math.isqrt(10**30 - 1))   # float sqrt is off by one for big integers
print(2**64, 7 // 2, -7 // 2, round(2.5), round(3.5))       # floor division rounds down; round() rounds half to even
```

Rules of thumb: compare floats with `math.isclose`, keep money in integer cents (or `Decimal`), use `math.isqrt` for integer square roots, and use `//` for integer division. Note that `round(2.5)` is 2: Python rounds halves to the nearest **even** number.

## Randomness: shuffling and sampling

**Fisher-Yates shuffle:** walk from the end, swapping each position with a random position at or before it. Every permutation is equally likely, in O(n). (Swapping each item with a random position anywhere looks similar but is biased.) `random.shuffle` does this.

**Reservoir sampling:** pick k items uniformly at random from a **stream** too long to store, in one pass: keep the first k, then replace a random kept item with item i (counting from 0) with probability k / (i + 1).

```python
import random

def fisher_yates(items, rng):
    items = items[:]
    for i in range(len(items) - 1, 0, -1):
        j = rng.randint(0, i)                  # a position at or before i
        items[i], items[j] = items[j], items[i]
    return items

def reservoir(stream, k, rng):
    sample = []
    for i, item in enumerate(stream):
        if i < k:
            sample.append(item)
        else:
            j = rng.randint(0, i)              # keep item i with probability k / (i + 1)
            if j < k:
                sample[j] = item
    return sample

rng = random.Random(42)                         # seeded, so the run is reproducible
print(fisher_yates(list(range(10)), rng))
print(reservoir(range(1_000_000), 5, rng))

counts = [0] * 10                               # each of 10 items should be picked about 3 / 10 of the time
for _ in range(20_000):
    for x in reservoir(range(10), 3, rng):
        counts[x] += 1
print([round(c / 20_000, 2) for c in counts])
```

Randomness also protects algorithms from worst-case inputs: random pivots in quicksort and quickselect (Lesson 27), random hash seeds, and treaps and skip lists (Lesson 31).

## Common mistakes

- Dividing modded numbers with `/` or `//` instead of multiplying by an inverse.
- Taking the modulus only at the end, letting numbers grow huge (slow in Python, overflow elsewhere).
- Comparing floats with `==`, or using `int(math.sqrt(n))` for big integers instead of `math.isqrt`.
- Writing a "shuffle" that swaps with any position, which isn't uniform; use Fisher-Yates.

## Exercises

### 1. Count the primes

Write `count_primes(n)` returning how many prime numbers are **less than** `n`. It must handle n = 2,000,000 in well under a second.

Starter code:

```python
def count_primes(n):
    pass

print(count_primes(10))   # 4: 2, 3, 5, 7
```

<details>
<summary>🧭 How to approach it</summary>

1. **Understand:** strictly less than n; 0, 1 and 2 give 0.
2. **Examples:** n = 10 → 2, 3, 5, 7 → 4.
3. **Brute force:** trial division for each number: O(n √n).
4. **Pattern:** **sieve of Eratosthenes**.
5. **Plan:** a flag list; cross out multiples starting at p²; only p up to √n needed; count the remaining flags.
6. **Code and test:** n ≤ 2, n = 3, known counts (25 below 100, 168 below 1,000).

</details>

<details>
<summary>💡 Hint 1</summary>

Testing each number separately repeats a lot of work. Instead of asking "is x prime?", cross out the numbers that **can't** be prime.

</details>

<details>
<summary>💡 Hint 2</summary>

Sieve of Eratosthenes: start with every number marked prime; for each p still marked, cross out p², p² + p, p² + 2p, … (any smaller multiple has a smaller factor and is already crossed out).

</details>

<details>
<summary>💡 Hint 3</summary>

`is_prime = [True] * n`, mark 0 and 1 False; for p while `p * p < n`: if `is_prime[p]`, set every `is_prime[m]` for m in `range(p * p, n, p)` to False. Return `sum(is_prime)`.

</details>

### 2. Combinations modulo a prime

`queries` is a list of pairs `(n, k)` with 0 ≤ n ≤ 100,000. Write `comb_mod(queries)` returning a list with C(n, k) mod 1,000,000,007 for each pair (0 when k < 0 or k > n). It must answer 20,000 queries quickly: `math.comb` builds huge exact numbers and is far too slow for that many.

Starter code:

```python
MOD = 10**9 + 7

def comb_mod(queries):
    pass

print(comb_mod([(5, 2), (10, 0), (10, 10), (3, 5)]))   # [10, 1, 1, 0]
```

<details>
<summary>🧭 How to approach it</summary>

1. **Understand:** many queries; answers mod a prime; k outside 0..n gives 0.
2. **Examples:** C(5, 2) = 10; C(3, 5) = 0.
3. **Brute force:** `math.comb` per query: exact big integers with tens of thousands of digits.
4. **Pattern:** **precompute once, answer in O(1)**: factorial and inverse-factorial tables with **modular inverses**.
5. **Plan:** tables up to the largest n; one inverse with `pow`, the rest by a backwards loop.
6. **Code and test:** C(0, 0), k out of range, the largest n.

</details>

<details>
<summary>💡 Hint 1</summary>

C(n, k) = n! / (k! (n − k)!). Factorials mod p are easy to build in one loop. What replaces the division?

</details>

<details>
<summary>💡 Hint 2</summary>

Multiplying by modular inverses. For a prime p, the inverse of a is `pow(a, p - 2, p)`. Precompute `fact[i]` and `inv_fact[i]` for every i up to the largest n, once.

</details>

<details>
<summary>💡 Hint 3</summary>

Build `fact` with `fact[i] = fact[i-1] * i % MOD`. Set `inv_fact[N-1] = pow(fact[N-1], MOD - 2, MOD)`, then go down with `inv_fact[i-1] = inv_fact[i] * i % MOD`. Answer each query as `fact[n] * inv_fact[k] % MOD * inv_fact[n-k] % MOD`.

<summary>✅ 1. Count the primes</summary>

```python
def count_primes(n):
    if n < 3:
        return 0
    is_prime = [True] * n
    is_prime[0] = is_prime[1] = False
    p = 2
    while p * p < n:
        if is_prime[p]:
            for multiple in range(p * p, n, p):    # smaller multiples were crossed out by smaller primes
                is_prime[multiple] = False
        p += 1
    return sum(is_prime)                           # True counts as 1

print(count_primes(10))
```

**Line by line**

- `is_prime` has one flag per number from 0 to n − 1; 0 and 1 are not prime.
- The loop only needs p with p² < n: a composite number below n has a factor at most √n, so it's crossed out by then.
- Crossing out starts at p × p because p × 2, p × 3, … were already crossed out as multiples of 2, 3, ….
- `sum(is_prime)` counts the True values.

**Trace** for n = 30: p = 2 crosses out 4, 6, …, 28; p = 3 crosses out 9, 15, 21, 27 (and others already gone); p = 5 crosses out 25. p = 6 has 36 > 30, so stop: 10 primes remain.

**Complexity:** O(n log log n) time, O(n) space.

**Common wrong approach:** starting the inner loop at 2p and running p all the way to n: still correct, but much slower; or forgetting that n itself isn't counted.

<summary>✅ 2. Combinations modulo a prime</summary>

```python
MOD = 10**9 + 7

def comb_mod(queries):
    N = max((n for n, k in queries), default=0) + 1
    fact = [1] * N
    for i in range(1, N):
        fact[i] = fact[i - 1] * i % MOD                 # i! mod p
    inv_fact = [1] * N
    inv_fact[N - 1] = pow(fact[N - 1], MOD - 2, MOD)    # Fermat: a^(p-2) is a's inverse mod a prime p
    for i in range(N - 1, 0, -1):
        inv_fact[i - 1] = inv_fact[i] * i % MOD         # 1/(i-1)! = i/i!
    out = []
    for n, k in queries:
        if k < 0 or k > n:
            out.append(0)
        else:
            out.append(fact[n] * inv_fact[k] % MOD * inv_fact[n - k] % MOD)
    return out

print(comb_mod([(5, 2), (10, 0), (10, 10), (3, 5)]))
```

**Line by line**

- `fact[i]` holds i! mod p, built from the previous value.
- Only **one** `pow` call is needed: the inverse of N−1 factorial. Because (i − 1)! = i! / i, its inverse is `inv_fact[i] * i`, so the loop fills the rest going down.
- Each answer multiplies three precomputed numbers, taking `% MOD` after each product so the numbers stay small.
- Out-of-range k is answered with 0 before indexing.

**Trace** for C(5, 2) (small numbers, so the modulus never kicks in): fact = 1, 1, 2, 6, 24, 120; 5! / (2! · 3!) = 120 / (2 · 6) = 10, computed as 120 × inverse(2) × inverse(6).

**Complexity:** O(N + Q) time for the largest n = N and Q queries (plus one O(log p) power), O(N) space.

**Common wrong approach:** computing `fact[n] // (fact[k] * fact[n - k])` with the modded factorials. Integer division of remainders gives nonsense; modular division must use inverses.

<details>
<summary>Quiz answers</summary>

1. **A) The greatest common divisor, in O(log min(a, b)) steps**: gcd(a, b) = gcd(b, a mod b); the numbers shrink quickly.
2. **A) Smaller multiples of p have a smaller prime factor and are already crossed out**: For example, 3 × 2 = 6 was already crossed out as a multiple of 2.
3. **A) Multiply by b's modular inverse, pow(b, p − 2, p) or pow(b, -1, p)**: Division doesn't distribute over mod; multiplying by the inverse does.
4. **A) k uniformly random items from a stream, in one pass and O(k) memory**: Item i replaces a kept item with probability k / (i + 1).
