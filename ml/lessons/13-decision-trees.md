## Key terms

- **Decision tree:** a model that predicts by asking a series of yes/no questions about the features.
- **Root:** the first question at the top of a tree.
- **Node:** a point in the tree where a question splits the rows.
- **Leaf:** an end point of the tree that gives the prediction.
- **Depth:** the number of questions on the longest path from the root to a leaf.
- **Gini impurity:** a measure of how mixed the classes in a group are; 0 means all one class.
- **max_depth:** a limit on how deep a tree can grow; the main way to stop it overfitting.
- **min_samples_leaf:** the smallest number of training rows allowed in a leaf.
- **export_text:** prints a fitted tree as readable if/else rules.
- **Feature importance:** how much each feature helped the model; for trees, the total impurity reduction from its splits.
- **Interaction:** when one feature's effect depends on another, such as support calls mattering mostly for new customers.

A **decision tree** predicts by asking yes/no questions about the features, one after another, like a game of 20 questions:

![A small decision tree for churn. The first question at the top (the root) is "tenure 10.5 months or less?". Each branch then asks "more than 2.5 support calls?". The leaf for new customers with many calls predicts "leaves"; the other leaves predict "stays". Each box shows how many training customers reached it and what share of them left](../figures/decision-tree.svg)

- The first question is the **root**. Each question is a **node** (or split); the end points that give the answer are **leaves**.
- To predict, start at the root and follow the answers down to a leaf. The leaf predicts the most common class among the training rows that ended up there.
- The **depth** is the number of questions on the longest path.

## How a tree picks its questions

At each node the tree tries **every feature and every cut-off** ("tenure ≤ 1?", "≤ 2?", … "support calls ≤ 3?"…) and keeps the question that best separates the classes: the one that makes the two groups it creates as **pure** as possible (mostly stayers on one side, mostly leavers on the other). The usual measure of mixed-ness is **Gini impurity**: 0 for a group that's all one class, 0.5 for a 50/50 mix of two classes. Then it repeats inside each group.

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier, export_text

churn = pd.read_csv("churn.csv")
features = ["tenure_months", "monthly_charge", "support_calls", "data_gb"]
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    churn[features], churn["churned"], test_size=0.25, random_state=0, stratify=churn["churned"])

tree = DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=2, random_state=0).fit(X_train, y_train)
print(export_text(tree, feature_names=features))
print("test accuracy:", round(tree.score(X_test, y_test), 3))
```

`export_text` prints the tree as indented rules. The tree found, by itself, the pattern a retention manager would put in plain words: **new customers who keep calling support are the ones who leave.** (The right-hand branch ends in two "class: 0" leaves; the split still made those groups purer, it just didn't change the vote.)

## Trees in pictures

![Left: the fruit data with the regions a depth-3 tree predicts. The boundaries are all straight horizontal and vertical lines, making rectangles. Right: the same with an unlimited tree, which carves many tiny rectangles around single fruits](../figures/tree-boundary.svg)

Trees cut the feature space into **rectangles**, because every question is about one feature at a time. This also means:

- **No scaling needed.** "Is weight ≤ 150 g?" works the same in grams or kilos.
- They capture **interactions** (an effect that depends on another feature, like support calls mattering mostly for new customers) and **non-linear** patterns without extra work.

## Depth controls overfitting

With no limit, a tree keeps splitting until every leaf is pure, which on noisy data means memorising:

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier

churn = pd.read_csv("churn.csv")
features = ["tenure_months", "monthly_charge", "support_calls", "data_gb"]
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    churn[features], churn["churned"], test_size=0.25, random_state=0, stratify=churn["churned"])

for depth in [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 10, None]:
    tree = DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=depth, random_state=0).fit(X_train, y_train)
    print(f"max_depth={str(depth):>4}  leaves {tree.get_n_leaves():>3}  train {tree.score(X_train, y_train):.3f}  test {tree.score(X_test, y_test):.3f}")
```

The unlimited tree (`None`) has 182 leaves and a perfect training score, but the worst test score. The shallow trees do best here. Besides `max_depth`, you can limit trees with `min_samples_leaf` (each leaf needs at least this many training rows) or `max_leaf_nodes`.

Single trees are easy to read but **unstable**: a few different training rows can produce a very different tree. The next lesson fixes that by combining many trees.

## Which features did it use?

`feature_importances_` says how much each feature reduced impurity across all the tree's splits (they add up to 1):

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier

churn = pd.read_csv("churn.csv")
features = ["tenure_months", "monthly_charge", "support_calls", "data_gb"]
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    churn[features], churn["churned"], test_size=0.25, random_state=0, stratify=churn["churned"])

tree = DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=3, random_state=0).fit(X_train, y_train)
print(pd.Series(tree.feature_importances_, index=features).round(3).sort_values(ascending=False))
```

## Common mistakes

- Growing trees without limits on noisy data and trusting the perfect training score.
- Over-trusting one tree's structure. A slightly different sample can produce a very different tree.
- Scaling features for a tree. It's harmless but pointless.

## Exercises

### 1. A readable rule

Train a `DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=1, random_state=0)` called `stump` on the split below. A depth-1 tree asks a single question. Store the name of the feature it splits on in `first_feature`, and its test accuracy in `acc`.

Starter code:

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier, export_text

fruit = pd.read_csv("fruit.csv")
features = ["width_cm", "height_cm", "weight_g"]
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    fruit[features], fruit["fruit"], test_size=0.25, random_state=3, stratify=fruit["fruit"])

```

### 2. Best depth

For the churn split below, try `max_depth` from 1 to 8 (with `random_state=0`). Store the depth with the highest **test accuracy** in `best_depth` (keep the smaller depth if tied), and the training accuracy of the **unlimited** tree (`max_depth=None`) in `full_train_acc`.

Starter code:

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier

churn = pd.read_csv("churn.csv")
features = ["tenure_months", "monthly_charge", "support_calls", "data_gb"]
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    churn[features], churn["churned"], test_size=0.3, random_state=2, stratify=churn["churned"])

```

1. Print `export_text(stump, feature_names=features)`; the first line names the feature.
2. Same pattern as choosing k: loop, and replace the best only when strictly better.

for depth in range(1, 9):
    acc = DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=depth, random_state=0).fit(X_train, y_train).score(X_test, y_test)
    if acc > best_acc:
        best_depth, best_acc = depth, acc
full = DecisionTreeClassifier(random_state=0).fit(X_train, y_train)
full_train_acc = full.score(X_train, y_train)
print(best_depth, round(best_acc, 3), full_train_acc)

<summary>Quiz answers</summary>

1. **A) Each split compares one feature with a cut-off, so units don't matter**: "weight <= 150 g" and "weight <= 0.15 kg" split the rows identically.
2. **B) Overfitting: it grew until it memorised the training rows**: Unlimited trees keep splitting until every leaf is pure. Limit max_depth or min_samples_leaf.
3. **A) The most common class among the training rows that reached it**: Each leaf votes with the training rows that ended up in it.
4. **B) Rectangles, with horizontal and vertical edges**: Every question is about one feature, so every boundary is parallel to an axis.
