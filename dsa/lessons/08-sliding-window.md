# Lesson 8: Sliding window

**You'll learn:** fixed-size windows, variable windows that grow and shrink, the template, why it's O(n), longest substring without repeats, shortest subarray with a target sum, when windows don't work.

▶ **Practise this lesson in the [sandbox](https://kishoremadanagopal.github.io/learning/dsa/#sliding-window)**: run every example and check your exercise answers.

## Key terms

- **Sliding window:** a contiguous range [left, right] that moves through the data and is updated instead of recomputed.
- **Fixed-size window:** a window of exactly k items; one item joins and one leaves at each step.
- **Variable-size window:** a window that grows on the right and shrinks on the left to keep a rule true.
- **Substring:** a contiguous run of characters in a string.
- **Subarray:** a contiguous run of items in an array.
- **Window state:** what you keep about the window (a sum, counts, a set) so updates are O(1).
- **Monotonic rule:** a rule where growing an invalid window can never make it valid again; needed for variable windows.

Many problems ask about **contiguous** runs: "the largest sum of any 5 days in a row", "the longest substring with no repeated letter". The brute force looks at every start and end: O(n²) windows, often with O(n) work each. A **sliding window** keeps track of the current run and **updates** it as it moves, so each item enters and leaves once: O(n).

![A row of numbers with a window of size 3 highlighted. As the window slides one step right, one number leaves on the left and one joins on the right, so the new sum is the old sum minus the leaving number plus the joining number](../figures/sliding-window.svg)

## Fixed-size window

Largest sum of k consecutive numbers. Instead of re-adding k numbers for every position, slide: add the number that enters, subtract the one that leaves.

```python
def max_window_sum(nums, k):
    window = sum(nums[:k])                    # the first window
    best = window
    for i in range(k, len(nums)):
        window += nums[i] - nums[i - k]       # one joins, one leaves
        best = max(best, window)
    return best

print(max_window_sum([2, 1, 5, 1, 3, 2], 3))   # 5 + 1 + 3
```

## Variable-size window: grow and shrink

When the window's size isn't fixed, use two pointers, `left` and `right`. Move `right` to **grow** the window; when the window breaks the rule, move `left` to **shrink** it until it's valid again. Track the best valid window as you go.

Shortest subarray with sum at least a target (all numbers positive):

```python
def min_len_at_least(nums, target):
    left = 0
    total = 0
    best = float("inf")
    for right, x in enumerate(nums):
        total += x                             # grow
        while total >= target:                 # valid: try to shrink
            best = min(best, right - left + 1)
            total -= nums[left]
            left += 1
    return 0 if best == float("inf") else best

print(min_len_at_least([2, 3, 1, 2, 4, 3], 7))   # [4, 3]
```

Even with a `while` inside the `for`, it's O(n): `left` only ever moves forward, so across the whole run it moves at most n times. This **"each pointer moves at most n times"** argument is how you prove sliding windows are linear.

Longest substring without a repeated character, using a set for what's in the window:

```python
def longest_unique(s):
    seen = set()
    left = best = 0
    for right, ch in enumerate(s):
        while ch in seen:                    # repeat: shrink from the left
            seen.remove(s[left])
            left += 1
        seen.add(ch)
        best = max(best, right - left + 1)
    return best

print(longest_unique("abcabcbb"), longest_unique("bbbbb"), longest_unique("pwwkew"))
```

## The template

```python
left = 0
state = empty                      # sum, counts, set... whatever the rule needs
for right in range(len(data)):
    add data[right] to state
    while the window is invalid:   # (or: if the window is too big, for fixed size)
        remove data[left] from state
        left += 1
    update the answer with the window [left, right]
```

Sliding windows need the rule to be **monotonic**: once a window is invalid, growing it can't make it valid again. With negative numbers, "sum at least target" breaks that, and you need prefix sums (Lesson 9) instead.

## Common mistakes

- Recomputing the whole window at every step, which makes it O(n·k).
- Starting the best value at 0 when all values could be negative.
- Moving the left pointer backwards (the "abba" bug).
- Using a sliding window with negative numbers for "sum at least target"; use prefix sums instead.

## Exercises

### 1. Best k days in a row

Write `max_window_sum(nums, k)` that returns the largest sum of any `k` consecutive numbers. You can assume `1 <= k <= len(nums)`. Numbers can be negative. Make it fast for 100,000 numbers with k = 5,000.

Starter code:

```python
def max_window_sum(nums, k):
    pass
```

<details>
<summary>🧭 How to approach it</summary>

1. **Understand:** contiguous runs of exactly k; return the biggest sum; negatives allowed (so the answer can be negative).
2. **Examples:** `[2, 1, 5, 1, 3, 2]`, k = 3 → 9 (5 + 1 + 3). `[-5, -2, -3]`, k = 2 → −5.
3. **Brute force:** sum every window: O(n·k). With n = 100,000 and k = 5,000 that's 500 million additions.
4. **Pattern:** "k consecutive" → **fixed-size sliding window**.
5. **Plan:** sum the first window; slide: add the new number, subtract the old; track the max.
6. **Code and test:** start `best` from the first window, not 0, so all-negative inputs work.

<details>
<summary>💡 Hint 1</summary>

Two neighbouring windows share k − 1 numbers. Don't add them up again.

</details>

<details>
<summary>💡 Hint 2</summary>

Moving the window right by one: the number at `i` joins and the number at `i - k` leaves.

</details>

<details>
<summary>💡 Hint 3</summary>

`window = sum(nums[:k])`, `best = window`; for `i` from k to the end: `window += nums[i] - nums[i - k]`, `best = max(best, window)`.

</details>

### 2. Longest substring without repeats

Write `longest_unique(s)` returning the length of the longest substring (a contiguous run of characters) with no repeated character. Make it fast for strings of 200,000 characters.

Starter code:

```python
def longest_unique(s):
    pass
```

<details>
<summary>🧭 How to approach it</summary>

1. **Understand:** substring = contiguous; return a length; empty string → 0.
2. **Examples:** "abcabcbb" → 3; "pwwkew" → 3 ("wke"); "abba" → 2.
3. **Brute force:** for every start, extend until a repeat: O(n²) or O(n³) with set rebuilding.
4. **Pattern:** "longest contiguous … with no repeats" → **variable sliding window** + a **set** of what's inside.
5. **Plan:** grow right; while the new character is already inside, remove from the left; record the window length.
6. **Code and test:** "abba" is the classic trap: make sure `left` only moves forward.

</details>

<details>
<summary>💡 Hint 1</summary>

Keep a window `s[left:right + 1]` that never contains a repeat, and a set of the characters in it.

</details>

<details>
<summary>💡 Hint 2</summary>

Each new character extends the window on the right. If it's already in the set, shrink from the left until it isn't.

</details>

<details>
<summary>💡 Hint 3</summary>

For each `right, ch`: `while ch in seen: seen.remove(s[left]); left += 1`, then `seen.add(ch)` and `best = max(best, right - left + 1)`.

<summary>✅ 1. Best k days in a row</summary>

```python
def max_window_sum(nums, k):
    window = sum(nums[:k])
    best = window
    for i in range(k, len(nums)):
        window += nums[i] - nums[i - k]
        best = max(best, window)
    return best
```

**Line by line**

- `window = sum(nums[:k])` is the only full sum we ever compute: O(k).
- `for i in range(k, len(nums))`: `i` is the index of the number **joining** the window; `i - k` is the one **leaving**.
- `window += nums[i] - nums[i - k]` updates in O(1).
- `best = window` at the start (not 0), because with all-negative numbers 0 isn't a real window sum.

**Trace** on `[2, 1, 5, 1, 3, 2]`, k = 3:

| window | joins | leaves | sum | best |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| [2, 1, 5] | | | 8 | 8 |
| [1, 5, 1] | 1 | 2 | 7 | 8 |
| [5, 1, 3] | 3 | 1 | 9 | **9** |
| [1, 3, 2] | 2 | 5 | 6 | 9 |

**Complexity:** O(n) time, O(1) space.

<summary>✅ 2. Longest substring without repeats</summary>

```python
def longest_unique(s):
    seen = set()
    left = best = 0
    for right, ch in enumerate(s):
        while ch in seen:
            seen.remove(s[left])
            left += 1
        seen.add(ch)
        best = max(best, right - left + 1)
    return best
```

**Line by line**

- `seen` holds exactly the characters in `s[left:right + 1]`.
- `while ch in seen:` the new character would repeat, so shrink from the left until the old copy is gone. `left` only moves forward.
- `seen.add(ch)` then extends the window.
- `right - left + 1` is the window's length.

**Trace** on `"pwwkew"`:

| right | ch | shrink? | window | best |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | p | | p | 1 |
| 1 | w | | pw | 2 |
| 2 | w | remove p, w | w | 2 |
| 3 | k | | wk | 2 |
| 4 | e | | wke | 3 |
| 5 | w | remove w | kew | 3 |

**Complexity:** O(n) time (each character is added once and removed at most once), O(k) space for the set, where k is the number of distinct characters.

**Faster variant:** store each character's **last index** in a dict and jump `left` straight past the old copy: `left = max(left, last[ch] + 1)`. The `max` is what makes "abba" work.

1. **A) Longest contiguous run of days with rising temperatures**: Contiguous runs are what windows track.
2. **A) The left pointer only moves forward, so it moves at most n times in total**: Count total pointer moves, not loop nesting.
3. **A) old sum + the number that joins − the number that leaves**: Only two numbers change.
4. **A) Shrinking or growing no longer moves the sum in a predictable direction**: The window needs a monotonic rule; with negatives use prefix sums.
